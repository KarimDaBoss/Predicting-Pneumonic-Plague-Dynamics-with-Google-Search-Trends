## Introduction

Welcome to the "Predicting Pneumonic Plague Dynamics with Google Search Trends" project! This repository explores the relationship between online search behavior and the spread of pneumonic plague in Madagascar from August to November 2017. By analyzing weekly epidemiological case counts alongside Google Trends data, we aim to uncover patterns that may help predict disease outbreaks.

## Project Overview

Pneumonic plague, caused by the bacterium *Yersinia pestis*, remains a significant health concern in certain regions. This project leverages data from Google Trends to examine how public interest in related search terms correlates with reported case counts. Our goal is to provide insights that could enhance disease monitoring and response strategies.

### Key Objectives

- Analyze the correlation between search trends and epidemiological data.
- Develop predictive models to assess future disease dynamics.
- Visualize findings to communicate results effectively.

## Data Sources

1. **Epidemiological Data**: Weekly case counts of pneumonic plague in Madagascar were obtained from health authorities and public health databases.
2. **Google Trends Data**: Search term data related to pneumonic plague was collected using the Google Trends API. This data reflects public interest over time.

## Methodology

### Data Preprocessing

We begin by cleaning and organizing the data. This involves:

- Handling missing values.
- Normalizing data to ensure consistency.
- Merging datasets for comprehensive analysis.

### Correlation Analysis

We employ correlation analysis to determine relationships between search trends and case counts. This includes:

- Calculating correlation coefficients.
- Identifying lagged relationships to understand delayed effects.

### Predictive Modeling

Using linear regression and other machine learning techniques, we develop models to predict future case counts based on search trends. Key steps include:

- Splitting data into training and testing sets.
- Training models using libraries like Scikit-learn.
- Evaluating model performance with metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

### Visualization

Data visualization plays a crucial role in our analysis. We utilize libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to create:

- Time series plots.
- Correlation heatmaps.
- Regression plots to illustrate model predictions.

## Results

Our analysis reveals significant correlations between Google search trends and pneumonic plague case counts. Key findings include:

- A strong positive correlation between search interest and reported cases.
- Lagged effects indicating that increased search interest often precedes reported cases.
- Predictive models that demonstrate promising accuracy in forecasting future outbreaks.
